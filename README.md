<p> Machine Learning Notebook is a jupyter notebook script designed to satisfy curriculum requirements in my computer science degree program.</p> 
<p>The application implements a supervised linear regression machine learning model on simulated student data. The output variable, Student Management
Index or SMI, is intended as a base metric used to balance classrooms evenly among a graduating class. The program also implements several data visualizations 
that may be used to better understand the (simulated) student graduating class.</p>
<p>Machine Learning Notebook is not currently under active development</p>

## Features

* Supervised linear regresssion model
  - Means Squared Error of model is 1.7009813268828067e-30 (Very good score; Lower scores indicate better accuracy)
* Utilizes 'pandas' data analysis and manipulation tool library
  - used to configure data for ML model
  - 'get_dummies' function especially useful for easily manipulating string types into compatible integer catagories.
* Data visualizations
  - histogram, pie chart, and bar chart useful for analyzing simulated student data
* Interactive model outputs with Python Widgets
  - Allows for calculation of SMI with user-specified attributes when notebook is ran in environment with Python Widget support
* Cross platform
  - Windows, Mac OS, and Linux ready
